First line: number of assets

The lines contain the data of each point. 
For each point includes

	i x y v d o1 c1 o2a c2a o2b c2b o2c c2c r1 r2 r3

Where
i = vertex number
x = x coordinate
y = y coordinate
v = asset value
d = service duration
o1 = opening time window in stage 1
c1 = closing time window in stage 1
o2a = opening time window in stage 2 scenario a
c2a = closing time window in stage 2 scenario a
o2b = opening time window in stage 2 scenario b
c2b = closing time window in stage 2 scenario b
o2c = opening time window in stage 2 scenario c
c2c = closing time window in stage 2 scenario c
r1 = number of vehicles type 1 required
r2 = number of vehicles type 2 required
r3 = number of vehicles type 3 required
  
* REMARKS *
	- The first point (index 0) is the depot.
	- The Euclidean distance is used 
	- A time window [0,20] is basically assigned to any asset that has no time window in the corresponding stage/scenario
